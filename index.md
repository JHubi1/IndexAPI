## Welcome to IndexAPI

You can include this script in any of your websites. just use for it: (But browsers like Chrome block that)
```markdown
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JHubi1/IndexAPI/main/indexapi.js"></script>
```

__**Or:**__ The better way is to download the file, put it on your server and access it from here:
```markdown
<script src="indexapi.js"></script>
```

I wish everyone a lot of fun with this expansion!
