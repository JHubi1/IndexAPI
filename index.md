## Welcome to IndexAPI

You can include this script in any of your websites. just use for it: (But browsers like Chrome block that)
```markdown
<script src="https://jhubi1.github.io/IndexAPI/indexapi.js"></script>
```

__**Or:**__ Another way is that you download the file, save it on *your* server and then call it that way:
```markdown
<script src="indexapi.js"></script>
```

I wish everyone a lot of fun with this expansion!
